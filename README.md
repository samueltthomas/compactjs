# Compact JS

Compact JS is a lightweight client-side JavaScript library which provides a very compact API to interact with the HTML DOM. It is compact both in terms of the library size and the API.  

The library is now just my hobby project only and its ready for production use.

## Example 

```javascript
    C('#id').h('<h1>Hello World</h1>');
```
